# Benchmark for Data Web Crawlers

**OR**CA is a **C**rawler **A**nalysis benchmark for Data Web Crawlers which runs on [the HOBBIT platform](http://project-hobbit.eu/).
Currently, the following types of data nodes are available:
- RDF data served in various formats over HTTP (dump and dereferencing variants)
- RDFa data embedded in HTML, based on the [RDFa Test Suite](https://github.com/rdfa/rdfa.github.io)
- SPARQL endpoints, based on [Virtuoso](https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/)
- [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) instances

| Average resource degree | The average degree of the resources in the RDF graphs. | [orca:averageRdfGraphDegree](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#averageRdfGraphDegree)
| Node type amounts | For each node type, the user can define the proportion of nodes that should have this type. | [orca:httpDumpNodeWeight](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#httpDumpNodeWeight) [orca:dereferencingHttpNodeWeight](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#dereferencingHttpNodeWeight) [orca:sparqlNodeWeight](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#sparqlNodeWeight) [orca:ckanNodeWeight](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#ckanNodeWeight)

## Key performance indicators

| KPI | Description | Ontology resources
| --- | --- | ---
| Recall | Number of true positives divided by the number of checked triples. | [orca:microRecall](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#microRecall) [orca:macroRecall](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#macroRecall)
| Runtime | The time it takes from starting the crawling process to termination. | [orca:runtime](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#runtime)
