# Benchmark for Data Web Crawlers

**OR**CA is a **C**rawler **A**nalysis benchmark for Data Web Crawlers which runs on [the HOBBIT platform](http://project-hobbit.eu/).
Currently, the following types of data nodes are available:
- RDF data served in various formats over HTTP (dump and dereferencing variants)
- RDFa data embedded in HTML, based on the [RDFa Test Suite](https://github.com/rdfa/rdfa.github.io)
- SPARQL endpoints, based on [Virtuoso](https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/)
- [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) instances

| Number of graphs | The number of graphs a node can have. | [orca:numberOfGraphs](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#numberOfGraphs)
| Average node degree | The average degree of the nodes in the generated graph. | [orca:averageNodeGraphDegree](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#averageNodeGraphDegree)
| Ratio of blank nodes | Factor that is multiplied to the number of nodes to determine the number of blank nodes that are added to the graph. | [orca:blankNodesRatio](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#blankNodesRatio)
| Ratio of literals | Factor that is multiplied to the number of nodes to determine the number of literals that are added to the graph. | [orca:literalsRatio](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#literalsRatio)
| Number of links between nodes | The number of links between the nodes of the synthetic graph. | [orca:numberOfNodesLinks](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#numberOfNodesLinks)

| Average resource degree | The average degree of the resources in the RDF graphs. | [orca:averageRdfGraphDegree](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#averageRdfGraphDegree)
| Node type amounts | For each node type, the user can define the proportion of nodes that should have this type. | [orca:httpDumpNodeWeight](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#httpDumpNodeWeight) [orca:dereferencingHttpNodeWeight](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#dereferencingHttpNodeWeight) [orca:sparqlNodeWeight](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#sparqlNodeWeight) [orca:ckanNodeWeight](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#ckanNodeWeight)

| Average crawl delay | The crawl delay of the node's `robots.txt` file. | [orca:averageCrawlDelay](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#averageCrawlDelay)
| Seed | A seed value for initialising random number generators is used to ensure the repeatability of experiments. | [orca:seed](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#seed)

## Key performance indicators

| KPI | Description | Ontology resources
| --- | --- | ---
| Recall | Number of true positives divided by the number of checked triples. | [orca:microRecall](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#microRecall) [orca:macroRecall](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#macroRecall)
| Runtime | The time it takes from starting the crawling process to termination. | [orca:runtime](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#runtime)
| Requested disallowed resources | The number of forbidden resources crawled by the crawler, divided by the number of all resources forbidden by the `robots.txt` file. | [orca:ratioOfRequestedDisallowedResources](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#ratioOfRequestedDisallowedResources)
| Crawl delay fulfilment | The average measured delay between the requests received by a single node divided by the delay defined in the `robots.txt` file. If the measure is below 1.0 the crawler does not strictly follow the delay instruction. | [orca:minAverageCrawlDelayFulfillment](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#minAverageCrawlDelayFulfillment) [orca:maxAverageCrawlDelayFulfillment](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#maxAverageCrawlDelayFulfillment) [orca:macroAverageCrawlDelayFulfillment](http://w3id.org/dice-research/orca/ontology#macroAverageCrawlDelayFulfillment)
